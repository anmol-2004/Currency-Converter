# Currency Converter

**Description:**
The Currency Converter is a web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows users to easily convert one currency to another. The app retrieves real-time exchange rates and performs the conversion instantly. It provides an intuitive user interface where users can input the amount they want to convert, select the source and target currencies, and view the result.

Whether you're traveling, shopping internationally, or just curious about currency values, this app makes it simple to convert money across multiple currencies.
